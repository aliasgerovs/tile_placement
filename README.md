# Tile Placement
This is a Python implementation of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver for a problem where you are given a landscape with different colored bushes, and a set of tiles that can be used to cover parts of the landscape. The goal is to find a placement of tiles that satisfies a target configuration of visible bushes.
